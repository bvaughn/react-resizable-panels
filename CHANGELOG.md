# Changelog

## Unreleased

- [616](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/616): Replace `Separator` and `Panel` edge hit-area padding with a minimum size threshold based on [Apple's user interface guidelines](https://developer.apple.com/design/human-interface-guidelines/accessibility). Separators that are large enough will no longer be padded; separators that are too small (or panels without separators) will more or less function like before. This should not have much of a user-facing impact other than an increase in the click target area. (Previously I was not padding enough, as per Apple's guidelines.)
- [615](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/615): Double-clicking on a `Separator` resets its associated `Panel` to its default-size (if there is one).

## 4.4.2

- [610](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/610): Fix calculated cursor style when `"pointermove"` event is has low-precision/rounded `clientX` and `clientY` values

## 4.4.1

- [600](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/600): Bugfix: Collapsible `Panel` should treat `defaultSize={0}` as _collapsed_ on mount

## 4.4.0

- [599](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/599): Add new `onLayoutChanged` prop to `Group`.

For layout changes caused by pointer events, this method is not called until the pointer has been released. This callback should be used if you're doing something like saving a layout as it is called less frequently than the previous approach.

The `useDefaultLayout` hook has also been updated to use this callback (though it will continue to support the old callback as well, with a `@deprecation` tag).

## 4.3.3

- [595](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/595): Don't call `event.preventDefault()` on "pointerup" unless a handle was actively dragged

> [!NOTE]
> This change also fixes a text selection bug that impacted Windows users (#574)

## 4.3.2

- Moved `flex-grow` `Panel` style to an inline value instead of a CSS variable defined on the parent `Group` to improve rendering performance. (This significantly reduces the negative impact from forced-reflow)

## 4.3.1

- [588](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/588): Replace `"unset"` styles with safer override values
- [589](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/589): Use capture phase for `"pointerdown"` and `"pointerup"` events; this is necessary for compatibility with certain UI libraries like Blueprint JS
- [590](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/590): Read `Panel` pixel size using `offsetWidth`/`offsetHeight` rather than `inlineSize` to avoid an edgecase bug with `ResizeObserver`

## 4.3.0

- [583](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/583): `Group` component now sets default `width`, `height`, and `overflow` styles; (both can be overridden using the `style` property)
- [582](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/582): Drag interactions only call `event.preventDefault` for the primary button
- Refine TS types for `useGroupRef` and `usePanelRef` to include `| null` to increase compatibility with older React versions
- Update TSDoc comments for `Panel` and `Separator` components

## 4.2.2

- `useDefaultLayout` hook initializes `storage` param to `localStorage` if undefined.
- Fix ambiguous type for `Panel` prop `onResize` that impacted certain TypeScript versions.

## 4.2.1

- [2a6b03f](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/commit/2a6b03f67d7d8fea8483a6a69bcdaebbe1b18a7a): Add `displayName` property to `Group`, `Panel`, and `Separator` components for better debugging experience.
- [577](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/577): `Group` handles newly registered `Panels` + `Separators` during mount so that user code can safely call imperative APIs earlier

## 4.2.0

- [573](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/573): Add `prevPanelSize` param to `onResize` callback to help simplify collapse/expand detection.

## 4.1.1

- [571](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/571): Update TS types to better reflect that `Separator` attributes `role` and `tabIndex` cannot be overridden using props.

## 4.1.0

- [567](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/567): `useDefaultLayout` hook supports saving and restoring multiple Panel layouts
- [568](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/568): Fix race in `useGroupRef` and `usePanelRef` hooks

## 4.0.16

- [563](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/563): Panel `expand()` API should restore pre-collapse size
- [564](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/564): Add guard for unexpected `defaultView` value seemingly returned by some dev environments

## 4.0.15

- [556](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/556): Ignore `defaultLayout` when keys don't match Panel ids

## 4.0.14

- [555](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/555): Allow resizable panels to be rendered into a different Window (e.g. popup or frame) by accessing globals through `element.ownerDocument.defaultView`

## 4.0.13

- `useDefaultLayout`: Deprecated `groupId` param in favor of `id` to avoid confusion; (there is no actual requirement for the Group to have a matching id)

## 4.0.12

- [552](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/552): `useDefaultLayout` now debounces calls to `storage.setItem` by 150ms

```ts
// To opt out of this change
useDefaultLayout({
  debounceSaveMs: 0,
  groupId: "test-group-id",
  storage: localStorage,
})
```

> [!NOTE]
> Some may consider this a breaking change, considering the default value is 150ms rather than 0ms. I think in practice this should only impact unit tests which can be easily fixed by overriding the default (as shown above) or by using fake timers.
>
> Changes like this are often judgement calls, but I think on balance it's better to correct my initial oversight of not debouncing this by default.

# 4.0.0
Version 4 of react-resizable-panels offers more flexible size constraints– supporting units as pixels, percentages, REMs/EMs, and more. Support for server-rendering (including Server Components) has also been expanded.

## Migrating from version 3 to 4

Refer to [the docs](https://react-resizable-panels.vercel.app/) for a complete list of props and API methods. Below are some examples of migrating from version 3 to 4, but first a couple of potential questions:

<dl>
<dt>Q: Why'd you rename &lt;component&gt; or &lt;prop&gt;?</dt>
<dd>A: The most likely reason is that I think the new name more closely aligns with web standards like WAI-ARIA and CSS. For example, the <code>PanelResizeHandle</code> component was renamed to <code>Separator</code> to better align with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Roles/separator_role">ARIA "separator" role</a> and the <code>direction</code> prop was renamed to <code>orientation</code> to better align with the <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Accessibility/ARIA/Reference/Attributes/aria-orientation">ARIA <code>orientation</code> attribute </a>.</dd>
<dt>Q: Why'd you remove support for &lt;feature&gt;?</dt>
<dd>A: Probably because it wasn't used widely enough to justify the complexity required to maintain it. If it turns out that I'm mistaken, features can always be (re)added but it's more difficult to remove them.</dd>
<dt>Q: Were the <code>onCollapse</code> and <code>onExpand</code> event handlers removed?</dt>
<dd>A: Yes. Use the <code>onResize</code> event handler instead:

```ts
onResize={(nextSize, id, prevSize) => {
  if (prevSize !== undefined) {
    const wasCollapsed = prevSize.asPercentage !== 0;
    const isCollapsed = nextSize.asPercentage === 0;
    if (isCollapsed !== wasCollapsed) {
      // Panel was collapsed or expanded
    }
  }
}}
```
</dd>
</dl>

### Basic usage example

```tsx
// Version 3

import { PanelGroup, Panel, PanelResizeHandle } from "react-resizable-panels";

<PanelGroup direction="horizontal">
  <Panel defaultSize={30} minSize={20}>left</Panel>
  <PanelResizeHandle />
  <Panel defaultSize={30} minSize={20}>right</Panel>
</PanelGroup>

// Version 4

import { Group, Panel, Separator } from "react-resizable-panels";

<Group orientation="horizontal">
  <Panel defaultSize="30%" minSize="20%">left</Panel>
  <Separator />
  <Panel defaultSize="30%" minSize="20%">right</Panel>
</Group>
```

### Persistent layouts using localStorage

```tsx
// Version 3

import { PanelGroup, Panel, PanelResizeHandle } from "react-resizable-panels";

<PanelGroup autoSaveId="unique-group-id" direction="horizontal">
  <Panel>left</Panel>
  <PanelResizeHandle />
  <Panel>right</Panel>
</PanelGroup>

// Version 4

import { Group, Panel, Separator, useDefaultLayout } from "react-resizable-panels";

const { defaultLayout, onLayoutChange } = useDefaultLayout({
  groupId: "unique-group-id",
  storage: localStorage
});

<Group defaultLayout={defaultLayout} onLayoutChange={onLayoutChange}>
  <Panel>left</Panel>
  <Separator />
  <Panel>right</Panel>
</Group>
```

> [!NOTE]
> Refer to [the docs](https://react-resizable-panels.vercel.app/examples/persistent-layout) for examples of persistent layouts with server rendering and server components.

### Conditional panels

```tsx
// Version 3

import { PanelGroup, Panel, PanelResizeHandle } from "react-resizable-panels";

<PanelGroup autoSaveId="unique-group-id" direction="horizontal">
   {showLeftPanel && (
     <>
       <Panel id="left" order={1}>left</Panel>
       <PanelResizeHandle />
     </>
   )}
   <Panel id="center" order={2}>center</Panel>
   {showRightPanel && (
     <>
       <PanelResizeHandle />
       <Panel id="right" order={3}>right</Panel>
     </>
   )}
</PanelGroup>

// Version 4

import { Group, Panel, Separator } from "react-resizable-panels";

<Group>
  {showLeftPanel && (
    <>
      <Panel id="left">left</Panel>
      <Separator />
    </>
  )}
  <Panel id="center">center</Panel>
  {showRightPanel && (
    <>
      <Separator />
      <Panel id="right">right</Panel>
    </>
  )}
</Group>
```

### Imperative APIs

```tsx
// Version 3

import { PanelGroup, Panel, PanelResizeHandle } from "react-resizable-panels";
import type { ImperativePanelGroupHandle, ImperativePanelHandle }from "react-resizable-panels";

 const panelRef = useRef<ImperativePanelHandle>(null);
 const panelGroupRef = useRef<ImperativePanelGroupHandle>(null);

<PanelGroup direction="horizontal" ref={panelGroupRef}>
  <Panel ref={panelRef}>left</Panel>
  <PanelResizeHandle />
  <Panel>right</Panel>
</PanelGroup>

// Version 4

import { Group, Panel, Separator, useGroupRef, usePanelRef } from "react-resizable-panels";

const groupRef = useGroupRef();
const panelRef = usePanelRef();

<Group groupRef={groupRef} orientation="horizontal">
  <Panel panelRef={panelRef}>left</Panel>
  <Separator />
  <Panel>right</Panel>
</Group>
```

### Disabling custom cursors

```tsx
// Version 3

import { disableGlobalCursorStyles } from "react-resizable-panels";

disableGlobalCursorStyles();

// Version 4

import { Group, Panel, Separator } from "react-resizable-panels";

<Group disableCursor />
```

## 0.0.56

Support a mix of percentage and pixel based units at the `Panel` level:

```jsx
<Panel defaultSizePixels={100} minSizePercentage={20} maxSizePercentage={50} />
```

> **Note**: Pixel units require the use of a `ResizeObserver` to validate. Percentage based units are recommended when possible.

### Example migrating panels with percentage units

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>v55</th>
      <th>v56</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre lang="jsx">
&lt;Panel
  defaultSize={25}
  minSize={10}
  maxSize={50}
/&gt;
        </pre>
      </td>
      <td>
        <pre lang="jsx">
&lt;Panel
  defaultSizePercentage={25}
  minSizePercentage={10}
  maxSizePercentage={50}
/&gt;
        </pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

### Example migrating panels with pixel units

<table>
  <thead>
    <tr>
      <th>v55</th>
      <th>v56</th>
    </tr>
  </thead>
  <tbody>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <pre lang="jsx">
&lt;PanelGroup
  direction="horizontal"
  units="pixels"
&gt;
  &lt;Panel minSize={100} maxSize={200} /&gt;
  &lt;PanelResizeHandle /&gt;
  &lt;Panel /&gt;
&lt;/PanelGroup&gt;
        </pre>
      </td>
      <td>
        <pre lang="jsx">
&lt;PanelGroup direction="horizontal"&gt;
  &lt;Panel
    minSizePixels={100}
    maxSizePixels={200}
  /&gt;
  &lt;PanelResizeHandle /&gt;
  &lt;Panel /&gt;
&lt;/PanelGroup&gt;
        </pre>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </tbody>
</table>

For a complete list of supported properties and example usage, refer to the docs.

## 0.0.55

- New `units` prop added to `PanelGroup` to support pixel-based panel size constraints.

This prop defaults to "percentage" but can be set to "pixels" for static, pixel based layout constraints.

This can be used to add enable pixel-based min/max and default size values, e.g.:

```jsx
<PanelGroup direction="horizontal" units="pixels">
  {/* Will be constrained to 100-200 pixels (assuming group is large enough to permit this) */}
  <Panel minSize={100} maxSize={200} />
  <PanelResizeHandle />
  <Panel />
  <PanelResizeHandle />
  <Panel />
</PanelGroup>
```

Imperative API methods are also able to work with either pixels or percentages now. They default to whatever units the group has been configured to use, but can be overridden with an additional, optional parameter, e.g.

```ts
panelRef.resize(100, "pixels");
panelGroupRef.setLayout([25, 50, 25], "percentages");

// Works for getters too, e.g.
const percentage = panelRef.getSize("percentages");
const pixels = panelRef.getSize("pixels");

const layout = panelGroupRef.getLayout("pixels");
```

## 0.0.38

- [#117](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/117): `Panel` collapse behavior works better near viewport edges.
- [#115](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/115): `PanelResizeHandle` logic calls `event.preventDefault` for events it handles.
- [#82](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/82): `useId` import changed to avoid triggering errors with older versions of React. (Note this may have an impact on tree-shaking though it is presumed to be minimal, given the small `"react"` package size.)

- [#94](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/94): Add `onDragging` prop to `PanelResizeHandle` to be notified of when dragging starts/stops.

## 0.0.36

- [#96](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/96): No longer disable `pointer-events` during resize by default. This behavior can be re-enabled using the newly added `PanelGroup` prop `disablePointerEventsDuringResize`.

## 0.0.35

- [#92](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/92): Change `browserslist` so compiled module works with CRA 4.0.3 Babel config out of the box.

## 0.0.34

- [#70](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/70): When resizing is done via mouse/touch event– some initial state is stored so that any panels that contract will also expand if drag direction is reversed.
- [#86](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/86): Layout changes triggered by keyboard no longer affect the global cursor.
- Fixed small cursor regression introduced in 0.0.33.

## 0.0.33

- Collapsible `Panel`s will always call `onCollapse` on-mount regardless of their collapsed state.
- Fixed regression in b5d3ec1 where arrow keys may fail to expand a collapsed panel.

## 0.0.32

- [#75](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/75): Ensure `Panel` and `PanelGroup` callbacks are always called after mounting.

## 0.0.31

- [#71](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/71): Added `getSize` and `getCollapsed` to imperative API exposed by `Panel`.
- [#67](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/67), [#72](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/72): Removed nullish coalescing operator (`??`) because it caused problems with default create-react-app configuration.

- [#64](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/64): Disable `pointer-events` inside of `Panel`s during resize. This avoid edge cases like nested iframes.
- [#57](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/pull/57): Improve server rendering check to include `window.document`. This more closely matches React's own check and avoids false positives for environments that alias `window` to some global object.

## 0.0.28

- [#53](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/53): Avoid `useLayoutEffect` warning when server rendering. Render panels with default style of `flex: 1 1 auto` during initial render.

## 0.0.27

- [#4](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/4): Add `collapsible` and `onCollapse` props to `Panel` to support auto-collapsing panels that resize beyond their `minSize` value (similar to VS Code's panel UX).

## 0.0.26

- [#41](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/41): Add optional `onResize` prop to `Panel`. This prop can be used (along with `defaultSize`) to persistence layouts somewhere externally.
- [#42](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/42): Don't cancel resize operations when exiting the window. Only cancel when a `"mouseup"` (or `"touchend"`) event is fired.

## 0.0.22

- Replaced the `"ew-resize"` and `"ns-resize"` cursor style with `"col-resize"` and `"row-resize"`.

## 0.0.21

- [#39](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/39): Fixed regression in TypeScript defs introduced in `0.0.20`

## 0.0.20

- Add `displayName` to `Panel`, `PanelGroup`, `PanelGroupContext`, and `PanelResizeHandle` to work around ParcelJS scope hoisting renaming.

## 0.0.19

- Add optional `style` and `tagName` props to `Panel`, `PanelGroup`, and `PanelResizeHandle` to simplify custom styling.
- Add `data-panel-group-direction` attribute to `PanelGroup` and `PanelResizeHandle` to simplify custom drag handle styling.

## 0.0.18

- `Panel` and `PanelGroup` now use `overflow: hidden` style by default to avoid potential scrollbar flickers while resizing.

## 0.0.17

- Bug fix: `Panel` styles include `flex-basis`, `flex-shrink`, and `overflow` so that their sizes are not unintentionally impacted by their content.

## 0.0.16

- Bug fix: Resize handle ARIA attributes now rendering proper min/max/now values for Window Splitter.
- Bug fix: Up/down arrows are ignored for _horizontal_ layouts and left/right arrows are ignored for _vertical_ layouts as per Window Splitter spec.
- [#36](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/36): Removed `PanelContext` in favor of adding `data-resize-handle-active` attribute to active resize handles. This attribute can be used to update the style for active handles.

## 0.0.15

- [#30](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/30): `PanelGroup` uses `display: flex` rather than absolute positioning. This provides several benefits: (a) more responsive resizing for nested groups, (b) no explicit `width`/`height` props, and (c) `PanelResizeHandle` components can now be rendered directly within `PanelGroup` (rather than as children of `Panel`s).

## 0.0.14

- [#23](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/23): Fix small regression with `autoSaveId` that was introduced with non-deterministic `useId` ids.

## 0.0.13

- [#18](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/18): Support server-side rendering (e.g. Next JS) by using `useId` (when available). `Panel` components no longer _require_ a user-provided `id` prop and will also fall back to using `useId` when none is provided.
- `PanelGroup` component now sets `position: relative` style by default, as well as an explicit `height` and `width` style.

## 0.0.12

- Bug fix: [#19](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/19): Fix initial "jump" that could occur when dragging started.
- Bug fix: [#20](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/20): Stop resize/drag operation on "contextmenu" event.
- Bug fix: [#21](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/21): Disable text selection while dragging active (Firefox only)

## 0.0.11

- Drag UX change: Reversing drag after dragging past the min/max size of a panel will no longer have an effect until the pointer overlaps with the resize handle. (Thanks @davidkpiano for the suggestion!)
- Bug fix: Resize handles are no longer left in a "focused" state after a touch/mouse event.

## 0.0.10

- Corrupt build artifact. Don't use this version.

## 0.0.9

- [#13](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/13): `PanelResizeHandle` should declare "separator" role and implement the recommended ["Window Splitter" pattern](https://www.w3.org/WAI/ARIA/apg/patterns/windowsplitter/)

## 0.0.8

- [#7](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/7): Support "touch" events for mobile compatibility.

## 0.0.7

- Add `PanelContext` with `activeHandleId` property identifying the resize handle currently being dragged (or `null`). This enables more customized UI/UX when resizing is in progress.

## 0.0.6

- [#5](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/5): Removed `panelBefore` and `panelAfter` props from `PanelResizeHandle`. `PanelGroup` now infers this based on position within the group.

- TypeScript props type fix for `PanelGroup`'s `children` prop.

## 0.0.4

- [#8](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-resizable-panels/issues/8): Added optional `order` prop to `Panel` to improve conditional rendering.

## 0.0.3
